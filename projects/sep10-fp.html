            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>This was a year long project where we had to pick a topic and pick a tool to learn about and do research on in order to develope our very own website that explains the topic we have been researching on.</p>
            <p>The topic that I chose was Construction. I chose this topic because I use to always wonder how they managed to make these super tall buildings called skyscrapers. Researching this topic about constuction also seemed interseting since I wanted to know how they use technology when helping them build these structures that looks super modern and eye catching. One example that I have found is called the mini excavter. It was first created to helped Japan's housing and urbanization. Another piece of technology that I found talks about how skyscrapers use a smart glass technology that allows for the user to control how much sunlight and heat passes threw the surface of the glass.</p>
            <p>For this Freedom Project we had to create a website then a google slides to sum up what your website was about. With these google slides we had to present them to our classmates and at the expo to the judges. For my google slides what I did was talk about how my tool helped me to create the website and then how my gadgets could help in speeding up the process of construction. At the end of my slides I listed very important takeaways that I wanted everyone to know incase they wanted to do a project like this one.</p>
            <p>What I made was a website that talks about these softwares and hardwares that I came up with. The site talks about how these softwares and hardwares are able to help speed up the time it takes to construct things such as building and etc. The website talking about 3 gadgets that can be very useful towards construction, they are called the “Sonetics Bluetoothheadset”, “Safety Glasses from Xoeye”, and “Construction Drone”. </p>
            <p>My takeaways are make sure to have a plan because without a plan it will be hard to start your project come up with many ideas so that way you can right them down in your notes and add them into your plan.Have a timeline so that way you can space out when you what to do this and that.</p>
